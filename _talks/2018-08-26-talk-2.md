We introduce a generalized version of the well know Ripleyâ€™s K function in order to obtain higher order characteristics for spatial point processes. The generalized K function admits a simple closed form for the Poisson process and a tractable analytical expression is obtained for the third order K function in case of the planar Thomas process. An unbiased nonparametric estimator for the generalized K function is also discussed.
