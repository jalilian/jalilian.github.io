A spatial point pattern $\mathbf{x}$ on $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$, $d\geq2$, is a locally finite subset of $S$; i.e.\ for any bounded Borel set $B\subset S$, $\mathbf{x}\cap B$ if finite. Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the set of all point patterns on $S$ and $\mathcal{N}$ denotes the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\mathcal{X}$. Then a random object $X:(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})\to(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{N},P_{X})$ is called a spatial point process on $S$. Assume that for each $t\in\mathbb{Z}$, $X_{t}$ is a spatial point process on $S$. Then $\{X_t: t\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is a $\mathcal{X}$-valued time series that can not be explained in the classical time series framework. Such time series are encountered in various applications.  For example, since 1980 locations of alive trees in the 50-hectare permanent study plot in the tropical rain forest of Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Gatun Lake, Panama,  been recorded in 8 consecutive censuses. In the present work, a framework for analyzing time series of spatial point patterns is developed and a simple model for the population dynamic in the BCI plot is introduced. In addition, parameter estimation for the proposed model is discussed.
